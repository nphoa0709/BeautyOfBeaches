We're not just talking about a beach with pure white sand and turquoise waters...we're talking about a true wonder of nature, the world's largest living organism, the Great Barrier Reef!

The scenery is just lovely with water on one side and the backdrop of Table Mountain and Twelve Apostles on the other. The place also has a lot of eateries and good restaurants where you can relax after a good swim / time at the beach. However, I would not suggest staying at the Camps Bay beach as it gets very dark and boring at night. A better place to stay would be V&A Waterfront and you can come to the beach either using a Hop On Hop Off bus or using Taxi (One way around 85 Rand)."

It's a dirt road that is graded regularly and in good shape but I'm glad we weren't in my car and that we were in my friend's truck. The trail in is well marked and very well groomed, even an athletic wheelchair could make it I think. People cart stuff down so I don't see why not. Beautiful hike but the best part is wandering the beach at low tide and exploring all the kooks crannies for various sea life and just neat sights. Would highly recommend."

One of the highlights of this trip was a tour we took with a company called Cove Adventures. They are based out of Port Hardy, B.C. The 8 hour tour (May 29, 2019) took us to Cape Scott Provincial Park, San Josef Bay. Absolutely stunning scenery. The owner/tour guide Chris was a fantastic guide giving us lots of history of the island. He had a wealth of knowledge about many stops we made along the way including a historical botanical garden called “The Bernt Ronning Garden”. His co-worker Leah also was very informative about the plants and vegetation. The tour included a delicious lunch with sandwiches made from the best homemade bread along with many other goodies, all from a local deli. Thumbs up to Cove Adventures, I would highly recommend the company to any tourist."
