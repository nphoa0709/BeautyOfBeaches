Lots of wonderful benches to sit on, and enjoy the view. And take binoculars too. You may see some whales off in the distance, as they head back to Alaska. Also, from the Black Rock resort, you can walk on another section of the trail going north. It actually goes for quite a ways that direction, all the way to the Artist's loop, and the big cedar tree loop. But then it's back the way you came from the resort. Make sure you pick up the brochure of the trail once you get there."
